# Connecting MongoDB to Express Lab

In this lab, we'll replicate what we did on Monday, but in a self-guided fashion.

To get started, copy or clone this repo/folder and then run `npm install` to pull in
the proper dependencies. You can `npm run start` to load the server with `nodemon`. This
will hot-reload the server while you write code so you can see the results in near real-time.

## Topics covered

1. Installing the MongoDB Node connector
1. Writing an async connection function
1. Using the `Application.{get,set}` methods in Express
1. Querying MongoDB from JavaScript
    - Finding documents by ID
    - Inserting documents
    - Deleting documents

## Directions

- Check out the comments in each of the JavaScript files to see what to do.
- Refer back to the example from Monday for guidance (or flag me down!)
    - `examples/mongodb-express-example`
