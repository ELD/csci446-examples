# README

This is a sample React app created with `create-react-app`.

## Overview

The code in the `src/` directory is what you'll find of interest.
More specifically, the `App.js` file contains the application code.

## How to run

I zipped this directory without the `node_modules` directory included to slim down the file size.

You'll need to run `npm install` before running `npm start` to run the dev server and serve the project.
