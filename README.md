# CSCI 446 Class Artifacts

This repository contains in-class examples as well as starters for various
assignments. This is meant to hold materials to refer back to and to also
assist in scaffolding assignments.

Not all examples are guaranteed to run as-is and may need some editing to get
running. They're reflective of the last place they were left in class.
